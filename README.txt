# LionBlast

This project consists of a game requested for the aquirement of the final grade of the 2nd semester of the Game Development course.
It's a game for 2 players, where each player must shoot at the adversary with their cannon, and the player to hit their adversary is
the winner. Each file has the following role within the project:
- LionBlast.cpp: Calls the functions necessary for the game and ultimately executes the game itself.
- LionBlast.h: Library with all the functions designed specifically for this game.
- LionMath.h: Library of math functions necessary for the making of the specific functions of the game.
- lionbrary.cpp: Library of basic functions.
- lionphys.cpp: Library of physics functions necessary for the making of the specific functions of the game.
- mapa1.cpp/mapa2.cpp/mapa3.cpp: Stages of the game.
- tanque.txt: Cannon of the Player 1;
- tanque2.txt: Cannon of the Player 2;
- todas.h: Library of basic functions, more complete than "lionbrary.cpp". Substitutes the calling of all the standard libraries.
